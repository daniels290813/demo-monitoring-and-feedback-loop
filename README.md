# Banking LLM montiroing and feedback loop demo

This demo showcases how to train, deploy and monitor LLM using an approach described as [LLM as a judge](https://www.confident-ai.com/blog/why-llm-as-a-judge-is-the-best-llm-evaluation-method).

In the demo we will train an open-source model to answer banking realted questions only. We will do so by analyzing the responses generated by the model traffic and retrain the model according to the performance. The model performance analysis will be done by a separate LLM used a judge to the results. Once we have a big enough dataset, we can then retrain the model and mesure the performance again.
